        <figcaption>As of 2022, 587 individuals from 41 countries had gone into orbit; 518 of
        these space fliers were men, and 69 were women. The longest time spent in space on one mission is
        the 438 days spent aboard the Russian space station Mir by cosmonaut Valery Polyakov in 1994–95.</figcaption>
